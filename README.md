## Contents ##

### This website is separated into 4 major widgets: ###

  1. The **Product Overview** module, created by Eunice Kim, is the main visual representation of the selected product and its given styles
     - Functionality and display:
       - Image gallery offers a default collapsed view and expanded view that allows alternate views of the same style
       - Styles can be changed via the style selector to the right of the main image
       - Size and quantity is reflected dynamically based on the style selected and the current inventory
       - An "add to cart" feature allows for a product with its selected style, size, and quantity to be added to the cart

  &emsp;  &emsp;  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; ![alt text](Overview.gif)
       
  2. The **Related Items & Comparison** module, created by Alex Shiao, will display two carousels populated by product cards
     - Considerations:
       - The outfits carousel only shows three items so that outfits can be added at any given location in the carousel
     - Functionality and display:
       - The first carousel shows the items related to the current product
       - Each card in the first carousel features a compare button that compares that item with the current item
       - The second carousel shows the items that has been added to the outfit list
       - The outfit list persists through page navigation
       - Each card in the second carousel features a delete button that removes the undesired outfit from the list
   
  &emsp;  &emsp;  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; ![alt text](Compare.gif)
     
  3. The **Questions & Answers** module, created by Casey Eads, allows access to product specific information outside what's provided by the Overview
     - Considerations:

     - Functionality and display:
       - Search bar at the top allowing matching question to be found after 3 or more characters have been input
       - List of already asked questions and provided answers ordered by Seller, then level of helpfulness
       - Ability to mark questions and answers as helpful or report answers
       - Modals to provide a new question or answer an existing one
   
  &emsp;  &emsp;  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; ![alt text](Q&A.gif)
       
  4. The **Ratings & Reviews** module, created by Adarsh Ravindran, will allow viewing and submission of reviews for the product selected
